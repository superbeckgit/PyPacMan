# PyPacMan
Author: Matt Beck
#
A python implementation of pacman via the tutorial found here: http://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/6-chomp.html . Since GASP is not windows compatible I swapped it out for graphics.py found here: http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python . graphics.py is based on tkinter so tkinter must be installed
#
# Installation instructions
Install tkinter module where python can see them (site_packages/)
